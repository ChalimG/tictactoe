public class HelloWorld {

}

// what is a class? A bundle of state - variables and values, and behaviour -
// methods / return values
// in the case of xsandos what is state - the rows and columns, the Xs and Os,
// the players
// what is the behaviour, we check if someone has won, rules about X and O
// placement (how you take a turn)
// there is alternation (its one persons turn, then theres another persons turn)
// what is an object - an instance of a class that has attributes

// minimax algorithm ? Implementation for tictactoe

// how can I make this less likely to bight me? - for example named constants

// Enumerations: limited set of values listed out

// Consider writing toString method if the class needs to be printed out

// behavioir" create a Board (instantiate a nw board), players take turns - a
// loop, until game ends - isOver() based on rules like:
// isValidSpace(), isWon(), isDrawn();

// Questions:
// Why was try used in Game.java? Why not do-while for instance?

// How do references work --> Heap and Stack?
// Why do we need a toString() method, what happens in the absence of one?
// top down design, how do I know which classes to make / which methods to
// implement?
// what is a good java class? what is a good java method --> how does this apply
// in general?
// Why is there an Object class? What are the intricacies of it?
